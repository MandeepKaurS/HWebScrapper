This would work well in association with Continuous glucose monitor (CGM). With such device, patient needs to keep an eye on their glucose value every now and then. H-webscraper can make it hassle free. It fetches the real-time value of glucose from the website where CGM data is being posted and runs the automated script, and notifies the user only when their glucose drops or increases than a certain threshold value.
