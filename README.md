Project Title: SweetWatch

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a Python script that fetches data from a website using Python web scraping tools, analyzes the data, and sends email alerts to the user if their sugar level is above the threshold value set by the user.

Methodology: The script will use web scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup to extract the data from the website. It will then analyze the data to determine the user's sugar level. If the sugar level is above the threshold value, the script will send an email alert to the user using the smtplib library. The threshold value will be set by the user and can be adjusted as needed.

Input: The script will take the user's email address and threshold value as input. The website URL will be hardcoded into the script.

Output: The script will output an email alert to the user if their sugar level is above the threshold value.

Libraries used:

BeautifulSoup for web scraping
smtplib for sending email alerts
Expected outcomes: The expected outcome of this project is a functional Python script that can fetch data from a website, analyze it, and send email alerts to the user if their sugar level is above the threshold value. The script will be easy to use and provide a convenient way for users to monitor their sugar levels.
