# HWebScrapper
It is a python script that will help the diabetic patients monitor their glycemic index and alerts them with a email notification if it goes out of the normal range. 

This would work well in association with Continuous glucose monitor (CGM). With such device, patient needs to keep an eye on their GI value every now and then. H-webscraper can make it hassle free. It fetches the real-time value of GI from the website where CGM data is being posted and runs the automated script, and notifies the user only when their glycemic index drops or increases than a certain threshold value.
